## About

## [command_line_menu_cn.hpp](./include/command_line_menu_cn.hpp) What it is?

This is the source code with Chinese comments.

### Why provide a Chinese commented version?

First of all, this project is only developed by me, and second, although I do not like to add non-ASCII characters in the source code, my English is not very good, which may lead to some English comments have expression problems, so I provide a version of the comments expressed by my mother tongue, Chinese.
